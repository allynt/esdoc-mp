What is esdoc-mp ?
--------------------------------------

esdoc-mp is an extensible domain driven design meta-progamming utility written in python.  It is an essential part of the ES-DOC eco-system of tools & services that allows developers to work with metadata in the encoding of their choice and in the programming language of their choice.

esdoc-mp achieves this by parsing a pythonic representation of a domain metadata schema and generating code in various programming languages.  


Why esdoc-mp ?
--------------------------------------

Metadata handling is typically complex and highly inefficient in terms of developer productivity.  esdoc-mp simmplifyies metadata handling by allowing developers to work with simple objects in the programming language of their choice.  This approach has been objectively proven to be a strong boost to developer productivity.


Who uses esdoc-mp ?
--------------------------------------

esdoc-mp supports the whole of the ES-DOC eco-system of tools and services.  It also used by other projects.
